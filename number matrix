Let Σ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. How many strings of length 3 or less are there over Σ?

let the language be {1,2}. How many strings of (say) length 3? Write 'em down! 111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222. Count 'em up! Here is 2^3. 
so for eight elements the formula for len 3 is 8^3=512. Then for len 2 is 8^2=64 and for len 1 is 8^1=8. 
At last don't forget to add empty string which is 1. Therefore total is 585
